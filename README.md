# HOW TO INSTALL,
**If you have Python installed:** Download repo, run Installer.py to build the executable from Grabbbit!.pyw, download both [dependencies](#dependencies) to the same folder as Grabbit!.exe<br/>
**Without Python:** Download [Grabbit!.exe](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1bX-R4mChJOjt73sqexZ2yMqIVT_Lnqg4), and download [dependencies](#dependencies) to the same folder as Grabbit!.exe
# HOW TO USE
If you are downloading more than one video or song(bandcamp album, youtube playlist, youtube channels), select Download Playlist.
A popout menu will appear.<br/>
If you would like to queue MULTIPLE downloads (downloading multiple youtube playlists, bandcamp albums), put , COMMAS between every URL. To name the folder it will be saved to, enter the name of the folder you wish to create in [] SQUARE BRACKETS.<br/>
Here's an example of two albums queued up to download:<br/>
`https://sampathegreat.bandcamp.com/album/rhymes-to-the-east[Rhymes to the east],https://sampathegreat.bandcamp.com/album/the-return[The Return]`
# DEPENDENCIES
Grabbit relies on [Youtube-dl.exe](https://yt-dl.org/latest/youtube-dl.exe) and [ffmpeg.exe](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EeMqfcI8w5rfU7wCIJEKgxO1waXgnvdb) for converting into mp4s/mp3s. Both must be in root directory with Grabbit!.exe
# TROUBLESHOOTING
If media is failing to download, attempt updating youtube-dl from the "Settings" menu. A window will appear and Grabbit will freeze for several seconds, this is natural.
As websites change and update, youtube-dl must be updated to keep up with them.
