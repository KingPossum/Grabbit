# DEPENDENCIES
Grabbit relies on [Youtube-dl.exe](https://yt-dl.org/latest/youtube-dl.exe) and [ffmpeg.exe](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1EeMqfcI8w5rfU7wCIJEKgxO1waXgnvdb) for converting into mp4s/mp3s. 
Updater.exe/.py is not needed for normal use, but if you wish to update Grabbit.exe through the program instead of github, it is required.
